## Description

"Palpite Box" was developed during the Fullstack Master Week, a workshop offered by DevPleno and taught by Tulio Faria. 

The application consists of an 'opinion box' ('Palpite Box' in Portuguese), where customers can make evaluations about an establishment and receive a discount coupon in exchange!

The app is connected to a Google Spreadsheet, which works as a database, where the business owner can activate/deactivate a discount, change the discount message, and manage received suggestions/coupons generated.

This is a very affordable, interesting, and easy to use feature that can make your establishment more appealing, while attracting more customers.
